## User Account Integration

### Ticket History

The Kiosk tracks user activity:

## Technical Implementation

### Event Data Fetching

The Kiosk loads event data from multiple sources:

```typescript
// Simplified data flow
async function loadEvents() {
  // 1. Get events from EventFactory contract
  const totalEvents = await eventFactory.totalEvents()
  
  // 2. Load each event's details
  for (let i = 0; i < totalEvents; i++) {
    const eventData = await eventFactory.getEvent(i)
    const kioskData = await ticketKiosk.getSalesInfo()
    const metadata = await fetchFromIPFS(eventData.metadataURI)
    
    // 3. Combine on-chain and IPFS data
    const enrichedEvent = {
      ...eventData,
      ...kioskData, 
      ...metadata,
      status: determineEventStatus(eventData)
    }
  }
}
```

### Real-time Synchronization

The Kiosk maintains current state through:

- **Contract event listening**: Watch for new events and ticket sales
- **Periodic polling**: Refresh event data every 30 seconds
- **User action updates**: Immediate state updates after purchases
- **WebSocket connections**: Real-time tip updates during live events

### Performance Optimization

Large event sets are handled efficiently:

- **Lazy loading**: Load additional events as users scroll
- **Image optimization**: Responsive images with fallbacks
- **Caching**: IPFS metadata cached locally
- **Pagination**: Server-side pagination for historical events

## Integration Points

### Room Access

Successful ticket purchases:

1. **Generate room URLs** for event access
2. **Initialize XMTP chat** group membership
3. **Enable tipping permissions** during live events
4. **Provide streaming access** to WebRTC endpoints

### Creator Dashboard

Creators see enhanced views:

- **Their events highlighted** with management options
- **Real-time analytics** for their events
- **Revenue tracking** across all events
- **Audience engagement** metrics

### Curation Workflow

Events may trigger curation flows:

- **Automatic detection** of events that could benefit from optimization
- **Scope recommendations** based on event characteristics
- **Integration with agent services** for enhanced promotion

## Error Handling

### Common Issues

**Insufficient Balance**:
- Clear error messages with current balance display
- Gas fee estimation and total cost breakdown
- Links to exchanges or faucets for acquiring SEI

**Network Issues**:
- Automatic network detection and switching prompts
- Fallback RPC endpoints for reliability
- Retry mechanisms for failed transactions

**Sold Out Events**:
- Real-time capacity updates to prevent overselling
- Waitlist functionality for high-demand events
- Alternative event recommendations

### Transaction Failures

Failed purchases receive:
- **Clear error explanations** in user-friendly language
- **Recovery suggestions** (retry, check balance, contact support)
- **Transaction hash** for blockchain debugging
- **Support contact** information for persistent issues

## Mobile Experience

### Responsive Design

The Kiosk adapts to mobile devices:

- **Touch-optimized** card interactions
- **Simplified filtering** with mobile-friendly controls
- **Optimized images** for various screen sizes
- **Streamlined purchase** flow for smaller screens

### Performance Considerations

Mobile optimization includes:
- **Reduced data usage** with compressed images
- **Faster loading** with lazy-loaded content
- **Offline capability** for previously viewed events
- **Progressive web app** features for native-like experience

## Next Steps

After purchasing tickets:

1. **Join the event room** at scheduled time
