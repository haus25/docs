## Why These Categories?

### Live Performance Focus
haus²⁵ prioritizes categories where the live experience adds significant value over recorded content:

- **Real-time interaction** enhances the performance
- **Audience participation** becomes part of the creative process
- **Spontaneity and improvisation** create unique, unrepeatable moments
- **Community building** around shared live experiences

### Underserved by Traditional Platforms

These categories often struggle on traditional streaming platforms:

- **YouTube/Twitch**: Optimized for gaming and vlogging, poor discovery for performance art
- **TikTok/Instagram**: Short-form only, difficult monetization for longer performances
- **Patreon**: Subscription model doesn't match live event economics
- **OnlyFans**: Content restrictions limit artistic expression

- **Global accessibility** without traditional venue limitations
- **Transparent value exchange** between creators and audiences
