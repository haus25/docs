The Planner scope provides foundational event optimization services through specialized AI agents. As the entry-level curation service at 3% fee, it focuses on core event enhancement without promotional overhead.

## Core Services

### Event Optimization

**Title Enhancement**: Gemini Flash-powered creative title generation based on category research, trending keywords, and engagement optimization patterns.

**Description Refinement**: Compelling event descriptions that balance informativeness with excitement, incorporating audience targeting and category-specific language.

**Pricing Strategy**: Data-driven ticket and reserve price optimization considering community engagement, category standards, and creator goals.

**Schedule Optimization**: Intelligent timing recommendations based on audience activity patterns, category trends, and optimal engagement windows.

**Visual Content**: AI-generated banner creation using Google Imagen with DALL-E fallback, incorporating event themes and visual appeal optimization.

## Technical Implementation

### Supervisor Coordination

The PlannerSupervisor coordinates all specialized agents through two-phase execution:

**Phase 1**: Shared context preparation across RAG, Research, Memory, and Blockchain agents
**Phase 2**: Parallel execution of specialized agents with shared research data

### Cost Optimization

**Shared Research**: Single category research call shared across all agents (35% token reduction)
**Model Selection**: Cost-effective model assignment based on task complexity
**Context Filtering**: Agent-specific data extraction to minimize token usage

### Performance Metrics

**Token Usage**: ~3,700 tokens per event
**Estimated Cost**: $0.065 per optimization
**Processing Time**: 15-30 seconds for complete plan generation
**Success Rate**: 95%+ successful optimizations

## Agent Interactions

### Context Sharing

All specialized agents receive:
- Category research insights (trends, pricing, audience)
- User history context (previous events, preferences)
- Market intelligence (current opportunities, timing)

### Output Integration

Agent outputs are structured into cohesive plan:
- Unified reasoning across recommendations
- Consistent tone and messaging
- Integrated visual and textual elements

## Quality Assurance

### Fallback Mechanisms

Each agent includes graceful degradation:
- **Title Agent**: Falls back to enhanced original title
- **Description Agent**: Provides structured improvement suggestions
- **Pricing Agent**: Uses category averages with safety margins
- **Schedule Agent**: Recommends popular time slots for category
- **Banner Agent**: Falls back to DALL-E if Imagen unavailable

### Validation

All outputs undergo validation:
- Content appropriateness checking
- Length and format compliance
- Brand guideline adherence
- Technical specification validation

## User Experience

### Input Requirements

Minimal user input required:
- Basic event details (title, description, category)
- Duration and rough timing preferences
- Any specific requirements or constraints

### Output Delivery

Comprehensive plan including:
- Enhanced event metadata
- Reasoning for each recommendation
- Alternative options where applicable
- Implementation guidance

### Iteration Support

Users can refine any aspect:
- Provide feedback on specific elements
- Request alternative approaches
- Adjust parameters and regenerate

## Integration Points

### EventFactory Integration

Optimized data flows directly to event creation:
- Enhanced metadata ready for smart contract deployment
- Optimized pricing for TicketKiosk configuration
- Banner assets uploaded to IPFS storage

### Curation Contract

Plan acceptance triggers:
- Curation contract deployment for selected scope
- Fee structure activation (3% for Planner)
- Proxy permissions for ongoing optimization
